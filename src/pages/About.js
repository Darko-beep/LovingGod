                    <h3>My Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm Ernestina, a passionate entrepreneur with a deep love for sharing God's Word and helping others grow in their faith journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a person whom GOD has saved through diverse ways. He has empowered me to share my journey of faith with others through the help of the Holy Spirit on this website after many trials, traumas, sorrows, and nightmares. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My testimony is one of God's amazing grace and redemption. Through every challenge, He has been faithful, turning my pain into purpose and my tests into testimonies. I pray that GOD would continue to help me as He has always done in my life in Jesus' Name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This platform is born out of a desire to see others experience the transformative power of God's love and to provide resources for spiritual growth and encouragement.
